### Contents

All workshop data and code are contained in this repository.    
- `data` Four subfolders of `ACi`, `AQ`, `Bayesian`, and `Gs` containing csv or ASCII files of Licor data (6800 and 6400)  
- `scripts` Three scripts for fitting parameters:  
  - `script_photo.R` Fitting CO2 and light response curves for C3 ('photosynthesis') and C4 ('BioCro')  
  - `script_stomatal.R` Fitting stomatal slope and cuticular conductance ('plantecophys')  
  - `script_Bayesian.R` Jointly fitting CO2 and light response curves for C3 ('PEcAn.photosynthesis')
